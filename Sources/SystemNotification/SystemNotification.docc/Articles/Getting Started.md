## Overview

After adding SystemNotification to your project, you can add a system notification to any view just as you add a `sheet`, `alert` and `fullScreenModal`, with a simple view modifier.

To add a system notification to a view, just use the ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotification(_:)`` view modifier with a state binding or a ``SystemNotificationContext`` instance.

> Important: Since system notifications should be as global as possible, make sure to apply the view modifier to the application root view, e.g. the main `NavigationStack` or ``TabView``. Any new sheets or modals must also have the modifier applied. 

State-based notifications take a boolean state binding and a view builder:

```swift
import SystemNotification

struct MyView: View {

    @State
    var isActive = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show notification")¬†{
                isActive = true
            }
        }
        .systemNotification(isActive: $isActive) {
            Text("You can use any custom content view")
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Context-based notifications just take a ``SystemNotificationContext`` instance and can then show many different notifications with a single modifier:

```swift
import SystemNotification

struct MyView: View {

    @StateObject
    var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show text") {
                notification.present {
                    Text("Context-based notifications are more flexible.")
                        .padding()
                        .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                }
            }
            Button("Show message") {
                notification.present {
                    SystemNotificationMessage(
                        icon: Text("üëç"),
                        title: "Great job!",
                        text: "You presented a native-looking message!"
                    )
                }
            }
        }
        .systemNotification(notification)
    }
}
```

The ``SystemNotificationMessage`` view lets you easily mimic a native notification view, with an icon, an optional title and a text, but you can use any custom view as the notification content view.

You can use the ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationConfiguration(_:)`` and ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationStyle(_:)`` view modifiers to apply custom configurations and styles, and the ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationMessageStyle(_:)`` to style the message.


## Styling and configuration

You can style system notifications with ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationStyle(_:)`` and ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationConfiguration(_:)``, which must be applied after the ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotification(_:)`` view modifier.

You can style system notification message views with ``SwiftUI/View/systemNotificationMessageStyle(_:)``. This lets you style individual messages while keeping the global notification style for the corner radius, background material, etc.


See ``SystemNotificationStyle``, ``SystemNotificationConfiguration`` and ``SystemNotificationMessageStyle`` for more information about how to style and configure these views.
